// A DStarGraph is a special interface that allows the DStarLite function to be used on a graph
//
// D*-lite is an algorithm that allows for the graph representation to change when actions are taken, whether this be from actions taken by the agent or simply new information gathered.
// As such, there's a Move function, that allows the graph to take into account an agent moving to the next node. This is always followed by a call to ChangedEdges.
//
// Traditionally in D*-lite, the algorithm would scan every edge to see if the cost changed, and then update its information if it detected any changes. This slightly remixed step
// allows the graph to provide notification of any changes, and even provide an alternate cost function if it needs to. This can be used to speed up the algorithm significantly
// since the graph no longer has to scan for changes, and only updates when told to. If changedEdges is nil or of len 0, no updates will be performed. If changedEdges is not nil, it
// will update the internal representation. If newCostFunc is non-nil it will be swapped with dStar's current cost function if and only if changedEdges is non-nil/len>0, however,
// newCostFunc is not required to be non-nil if updates are present. DStar will continue using the current cost function if that is the case.

// A DStarInstance is a way for a general Graph implementer to run D*-Lite. D*-Lite has state over multiple calls, and allows the graph to chnge, so after initialization an instance is returned.
//
// The general flow of D*-lite is that it's initialized and an initial shortest path is computed (essentially the same as A*). This is all done in InitDStar.
// This is followed up by a Step() which returns the node to move to. After this action is taken, the state of the algorithm is Update()d if any edge costs have changed. In general, running DStar
// directly will look like:
//
//     myDStar := InitDStar(... info ...)
//
//     * Repeat the following until Step returns error or you reach your goal *
//         move := myDStar.Step()
//         perform the move returned
//         if the graph changed, call Update(... change info ...)

// Runs D*-Lite in its entirety on an appropriate graph. What is D*-Lite? It's an incremental heuristic lifelong planning search. What this means is that
// unlike A*, it reacts to new information and can be used when the graph representation changes to replan paths. Perhaps the best way to understand D*-Lite
// is to read the paper it came from[1]. However, here is a (very) brief synopsis:
//
// D*-Lite begins by computing the shortest path between the start and goal, and assuming this is the path it will take. This step is essentially just A*.
// After moving a step, it will "take a look around" so to speak. It will scan and see if anything in the graph has changed, if it had changed, it recomputes the shortest path
// and uses the new one. The big trick in D*-lite is that since it has memory, this is significantly cheaper than rerunning A* at every step (though there are edge cases where performance may suffer).
//
// D*-Lite is a modification of LPA* (Lifelong Planning A*) that has the same behavior as a little-used algorithm known as D*. It is guaranteed to run as fast or faster than D*, and is generally
// known to run faster than LPA* and other similar lifelong planning algorithms.
//
// It is used often in real world robotics path planning -- a modification of this algorithm known as Field D* (which allows more degrees of freedom in movement) is used in the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.
// It was also notably used for traffic path planning in the recent reboot of the SimCity franchise.
//
// As with other algorithms with cost function arguments in this package, Cost and HeuristicCost are optional, and if absent will default to the graph's Cost/HeuristicCost functions (if present), and finally
// to UniformCost and NullHeauristic respectively.
