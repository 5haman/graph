// Returns an ordered list consisting of the nodes between start and goal. The path will be the
// shortest path assuming the function heuristic is admissible. The second return value is the
// weight, and the third is the number of nodes expanded while searching (useful info for tuning
// heuristics). Negative Costs will cause bad things to happen, as well as negative heuristic
// estimates.
//
// A heuristic is admissible if, for any node in the graph, the heuristic estimate of the weight
// between the node and the goal is less than or set to the true weight.
//
// Performance may be improved by providing a consistent heuristic (though one is not needed to
// find the optimal path), a heuristic is consistent if its value for a given node is less than
// (or equal to) the actual weight of reaching its neighbors + the heuristic estimate for the
// neighbor itself. You can force consistency by making your HeuristicCost function return
// max(NonConsistentHeuristicCost(neighbor,goal), NonConsistentHeuristicCost(self,goal) -
// Cost(self,neighbor)). If there are multiple neighbors, take the max of all of them.
//
// Cost and HeuristicCost take precedence for evaluating weight/heuristic distance. If one is not
// present (i.e. nil) the function will check the graph's interface for the respective interface:
// Coster for Cost and HeuristicCoster for HeuristicCost. If the correct one is present, it will
// use the graph's function for evaluation.
//
// Finally, if neither the argument nor the interface is present, the function will assume
// UniformCost for Cost and NullHeuristic for HeuristicCost.
//
// To run Uniform Cost Search, run A* with the NullHeuristic.
//
// To run Breadth First Search, run A* with both the NullHeuristic and UniformCost (or any weight
// function that returns a uniform positive value.)
